## Setters & Getters

Setters and getters are special methods used in object-oriented programming to access (get) or modify (set) the values of private or protected attributes of a class. They help encapsulate the internal state of an object, providing controlled access.

### Getter

- A getter is a method that retrieves (gets) the value of a private attribute.
- It lets you read the value without allowing direct access to the underlying variable.

### Setter

- A setter is a method that sets (updates) the value of a private attribute.
- It lets you validate or restrict changes before updating the attribute.

### Why Use Setters & Getters
- Encapsulation: Protects the internal state of the object.
- Validation: Allows you to add checks before changing values.
- Abstraction: Hides implementation details from users of the class.
